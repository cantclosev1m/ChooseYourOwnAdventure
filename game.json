You follow her lead through the tunnels of the labyrinth for what feels like ages, until you arrive at an underground pond, the water crystal clear and shimmering. The lady stops at the foot of the pond, staring at her reflection. You walk up to her left shoulder, taking a moment to glance at your own reflection, your face covered in grime and dirt, nearly unrecognizable from your time in this place. You then notice the lady's reflection, of which there is something deeply wrong with. Her face seems to be contorting and shifting inhumanly, as if something was trying to break free out of her face. She, or rather it, begins to shake with laughter. ''Did you actually think I was leading you out of this place? HA! You killed that poor fool blabbering about a demon, and you didn't find it odd there was nothing but a woman in the next room? You honestly deserve what I'm going to do you,'' the creature tells you, shifting its form in front of your very eyes. It grabs you by the nape with inhumanly strong hands and plunges your face into the water below. You struggle, but you lack the strength to break free. Water begins to fill your lungs. Though submerged in the water, you can still hear the being's maniacal laughter as your life fades...  ",

You stand still in shock, how could she know about the man you killed? Sensing your discomfort, the lady stops in her tracks and begins to laugh uncontrollably. ''What? Did you think I didn't know? What demon do you think he was raving about? You just thought you would be saved by some fair maiden after showing no such mercy yourself... fate has a cruel sense of justice, not that I've ever been one for the concept of justice.'' The lady turns to face you, what was once her face now contorted in an inhumanly long grin, with teeth sharp as knives glistening in the candle light.
